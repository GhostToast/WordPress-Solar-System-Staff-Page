WordPress-Solar-System-Staff-Page
=================================

This was created for a client who originally asked for something that resembled orbiting planets. It demonstrates how CSS animations can be dynamically generated with WordPress custom posts and post meta to create a modular solar system.

This assumes a custom post type called "staff" with several `post_meta` fields, as mentioned in the `archive-staff.php` page. This is not meant to be a fully working drop-in, plugin, theme, etc. But an example.
